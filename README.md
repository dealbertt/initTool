Simple bash scrip to initialize projects for different languages.  
This includes creating the right folders for the projects (like src, include, etc), creating a makefile (in the case of C/C++)  
To use this script anywhere on your computer, just type:  
  
```cmd
mv your_script.sh /usr/local/bin/your_script
```
